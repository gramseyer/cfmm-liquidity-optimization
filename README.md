## Usage

- The script `cfmm_lp2.py` computes for any given belief function (on the future valuations of assets)
	optimal CFMM designs and liquidity allocations.
	- Invoke as `python3 cfmm_lp2.py`
	- Custom belief functions can be added in `psi_func_custom(px, py)`.
	- The framework is general; alternative objectives (as in e.g. Section 7 of the paper, when accounting for liquidity provider
	fee revenue and divergence loss) follow from modifications to the objective functions.

- The script `lp_functions.py` provides auxiliary functions and implements various belief functions.

## Dependencies

The optimization toolkit relies on [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/), which can be installed via
```
python3 -m pip install cvxpy
```
